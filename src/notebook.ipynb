    "# Pneumonia Detection Using Keras\n",
    "This project aimed to create a three-way multiclassification model using a Convolutional Neural Network made with Google'stheneumonia. The purpose of this project is to create a quick and simplified way for anyone to classify pneumonia in children, possibly saving lives due to an early warning about the terrible disease.\n",

    "This model is trained on [this dataset from Kaggle][kaggle_link]. However, Kaggle groups the bacterial and viral pneumonia together, creating a binary image classification problem. I wanted to take it a step further, separating the types of pneumonia out for further classification. To accomplish this, I renamed the `PNEUMONIA` directories to `BACTERIA` and moved all the viral pneumonia X-Rays into new `VIRUS` directories, to allow for easier data retrieval and labeling. To run locally, ensure to follow the same steps.\n",
